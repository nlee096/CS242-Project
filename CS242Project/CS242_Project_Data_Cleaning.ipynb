As Franzi and Karl don't care much about their parents, Trudi and Rudi go to the Baltic Sea, where Trudi suddenly dies. Rudi is thrown out of gear, even more when he learns that his wife wanted to live a totally different life in Japan...Trudi (Hannelore Elsner) and Rudi (Elmar Wepper) Meieranger live in a small Bavarian village. Trudi learns from the family doctor that her husband Rudi is terminally ill. Trudi decides to keep the illness secret, and to follow the doctor's suggestion to have a final joint holiday, something the two have wanted for some time, but never did. She convinces Rudi to visit their children and grandchildren in Berlin. But when they arrive, they find that their children are too busy with their own lives to care for their parents.The Meieranger's continue their trip to the Baltic Sea when Trudi dies unexpectedly. In the fallout from this, Rudi learns about the life Trudi really wanted to live - and her secret obsession with Japan, and the modern Japanese dance \\\"Butoh\\\" - all of which she sacrificed out of love for him.Rudi decides that he would make up for the lost time in Trudi's life, and travels to visit his son in Tokyo. Due to the cramped conditions, and differences between them, the son soon wishes his father would leave.Rudi wanders through the parks during the Cherry Blossom festival, and meets a young Japanese woman named Yu (Aya Irizuki), who is dancing in the Butoh style. Rudi learns that Yu lives in a tent, having lost her mother only a year earlier. Despite the language, age, and cultural differences, the two soon became good friends.As Trudi always talked about how much she wanted to see Mount Fuji, Rudi persuades his new companion to help him travel there. When they arrive, the mountain is \\\"shy\\\" - constantly hidden behind clouds, so they retreat to a hotel room and wait for the weather to clear. Due to his deteriorating health, Rudi awakes one night and goes to the door, to see Mt Fuji clear in the bright moonlight. To honour his wife, Rudi puts on her clothes and paints his face like a Japanese dancer before walking to the edge of the lake, where he begins to imitate the slow movements of Butoh. Trudi appears to him in a vision, and takes him by the hand as they both dance before the majestic backdrop of the mountain and the lake.The following morning, Yu awakes to see Rudi's bed empty, then finds his body by the lake. In his luggage there is a package (\\\"For You, Yu\\\"), in which Rudi left her his entire life savings.Two contrasting scenes conclude the film: On the one hand, in a solemn cremation ceremony, his son and Yu are balancing the remaining ashes of Rudi's bones with chopsticks in a Japanese urn in the traditional manner. On the other hand, the children discuss their father their indignation at his grumpiness and his adventures with Yu; and what they see as his scandalous soft spot for Trudi's clothes, showing a complete lack of understanding.\",\n          \"Jennifer Fox faces a host of life-altering questions after a short story from her middle school days forces her to re-examine her first sexual relationship and the stories we tell ourselves in order to survive. An accomplished documentarian working in New York, Jennifer is completing her latest project, about the lives of women around the world. She receives a series of phone calls from her mother, Nettie, who has found a short story Jennifer wrote at the age of 13 for school. In it, she describes various encounters with her riding instructor Mrs. G and her running coach Bill while away at summer camp. Nettie is unnerved by the implications of her daughter's writing, but Jennifer is nonplussed. She has always looked back with fondness on the time she spent with the two charismatic adults. Egged on by Nettie and encouraged by her supportive fianc\\u00e9, Jennifer yearns to know more and sets out on a journey to find the real people 30 years later - the children, now adults, who also attended the camp back then-and eventually the coaches themselves. But the more she learns, the more her memories shift and the more questions she unearths. As her frustration mounts, she finds herself turning inward to get to the truth, imagining conversations with her 13-year-old-self and even Mrs. G and Bill in an effort to understand how and why events occurred so long ago.Based on real-life director Jennifer Fox, this film begins by introducing us to accomplished documentary filmmaker Jennifer \\\"Jenny\\\" Fox (Laura Dern) herself, a woman in her late forties who is currently working on a film project recording women and girls in third-world countries who have been sexually assaulted or harassed. During a protest for women's rights in Africa, Jennifer joins in despite being warned that these things can turn violent quickly. She's also a university professor living in a condo loft in an interracial relationship with her loving boyfriend, Martin (Lonnie \\\"Common\\\" Lynn). Jennifer has had relationship problems with Martin involving commitment and sexuality, adding tension to her life.One day Jennifer's elderly mother, Nettie (Ellen Burstyn) calls her up, distraught after coming across a school essay from the 1970's Jennifer wrote when she was thirteen. The essay is about a \\\"relationship\\\" Jennifer had when she was thirteen which she dismisses as upsetting her mother because her boyfriend was \\\"older\\\". Jennifer has a flashback to this era, which is portrayed as deeply nostalgic and a sweet romance in which she was able to find herself as a confident young woman. She pictures the 1970's almost like a bright super 8 home movie and seems to find it much more endearing than her own adult life. She imagines herself as being older and sophisticated as she re-reads the essay herself, but is surprised at how small and childlike she appears in photos from that time. Rethinking back on that time, she is now portrayed as a shy and awkward little girl whose parents often argue and ignore her. Jennifer's relationship began one summer when she went to a mysterious and intensive horse training camp with three other girls. She lived with the beautiful and enigmatic Mrs. G (Elizabeth Debiki), who also had Jenny and the girls run with professional coach Bill Allens (Jason Ritter), who was in his forties. Bill often treats the girls as a small elite group, getting them to refer to him by the unexplained nickname \\\"Naga\\\", which Jennifer finds cult-like looking back on it. She decides to get in touch with one of the other girls from the camp, an obese teenager named Franny (Tina Parker), who is now an adult woman running her own horse farm. Franny surprisingly has remained very close with the now frail and horribly aged Mrs. G, who reveals that her real husband (Grant James) is suffering from bouts of illness and that her bespectacled young son whom Jennifer was fond of, David (Brett Justin Koppel) passed away at a young age. Jennifer means to ask Mrs. G. about her childhood but is unable to bring herself to do it considering the tragic circumstances which have been brought up. Mrs. G. meanwhile makes a few bizarre comments about her own family, including that her mother \\\"preferred the dogs to her\\\". It is revealed that as a child in Britain, Mrs. G. may have been neglected and sexually abused.Jennifer goes with Mrs. G. and Franny to try riding again, and has flashbacks to an embarrassing time in which she fell off her own horse. Not long after though, she has a live show and displays her riding skills, getting closer to Bill in the process, whom she now considers a dear friend. Mrs. G. and Bill offer to drive her to a diner for lunch, playing Gordon Lightfoot music and chatting about Jennifer's own lonely and dysfunctional home life. As they eat, Mrs. G and Bill reveal to Jennifer that they are lovers. Jennifer reassures them that she's glad they're happy, and agrees to write letters to them after the summer when she returns home for school. After the camp, Jennifer keeps her horse with Mrs. G. and continues to see her and Bill on the weekends. These memories begin to haunt the present-day adult Jennifer. Doing a demonstration while teaching a class, she gets one of her students, Joe (Daniel Berson) to volunteer to stand in front of the class, and she discusses how a person's defensive body language is often a sign that they're trying to hide something more serious about themselves.Jennifer reflects on how after the summer when she was thirteen, the visits transitioned into her spending time with Bill alone. One night she stays over at his house and gets cold, so he wraps a blanket around her before reading her a poem of his. He begins sexually grooming her, requesting that she take her top off for him so he can ogle her, eventually raping her repeatedly, telling her that they are \\\"making love\\\". This makes her uncomfortable, but at the same time it becomes an act of rebellion. Her parents still ignore her yet refuse to let her date or make friends, barring her from going to a carnival with a friend named Lucas (Noah Lomax). Ironically her father claims to be friends with Lucas's father and to like the boy's family, yet Jennifer's parents see nothing suspicious about how much time she spends with Bill and Mrs. G. Jennifer realizes that her nosy grandmother (Juli Erickson) is aware of the \\\"relationship\\\", but the two never discuss it.When Martin in the present day finds letters written to Jennifer by Bill, he says that she was raped, but she refuses to see it that way, proclaiming that she is not a victim. However she slowly begins to question whether her recollections are accurate and eventually realizes despite her protests she had been exhibiting symptoms of being sexually abused for years. In flashbacks she is shown vomiting at the thought of sex, worrying her English teacher after turning in the essay (which discusses the molestation) and talking as if she is a mature adult in spite of her young age, isolating herself. As Jennifer continues to investigate her childhood summer, she realizes that Bill and Mrs. G. were probably grooming other girls. She remembers a college student named Iris Rose (Madison David) who worked for Mrs. G. Jennifer tracks the now adult Iris Rose down who tells her that she, Mrs. G. and Bill had threesomes and orgies and that Mrs. G. was actively involved in finding women for Bill. This prompts Jennifer to remember that she was supposed to participate in group sex with Mrs. G, Bill and Iris one weekend. However Jennifer, who vomited each time she was raped by Bill, had a severe panic attack at home and barfed the day before she was due to go away for the weekend, causing her mother to keep her at home, assuming she just had the flu. Realizing she no longer wanted to be in a relationship with Bill, Jennifer called him and broke up with him, even as he pleaded with her to stay. She also informed Mrs. G. she would no longer be keeping her horse with her.In the present day Jennifer tracks down Mrs. G. at her own home, trying to get her to talk about the sexual abuse. Mrs. G. realizes that Jennifer is researching it, and wanting to sweep it under the carpet, she pretends to have no idea what Jennifer is talking about, trying to make her leave. The elderly Mr. G., whom had never abused Jennifer nor been aware of his own wife's affair with Bill, comes downstairs to greet and hug Jennifer, but as they embrace, Mrs. G. insists that she leave, looking worried that the secrets of the past will be revealed. Jennifer has a conversation with her childhood self, telling her about the toll the abuse will take on her as she gets older, claiming that she'll never be able to have an intimate relationship without being reminded of the abuse and that she'll never want to be pregnant. The childhood Jennifer, too busy wandering the school hallways swooning over a barrage of letters Bill has sent to her, claims she \\\"doesn't love boys and hates children anyway\\\". She continues to insist that she's not a victim, but freaks out when the adult Jennifer tells her that she's going to speak out about the abuse, begging her not to tell.Now as an adult, Jennifer wants to confront Bill to ask him why he sexually abused her and if there were other victims. Martin worries for her that this plan will backfire or that she may only further traumatize herself, however he understands that this process is cathartic and necessary for her recovery, adamantly telling her that he still loves her and offering to wait outside for her as she visits an awards ceremony to confront Bill at last. At the awards ceremony where an elderly Bill (John Heard) is being honored, a furious Jennifer confronts him in front of his wife and the other attendees. Bill denies everything and leaves, however a couple of other women in the room stare at Jennifer with looks of sympathy, implying that they know all too well what she is talking about. Jennifer has a panic attack, shouting, \\\"What? Hasn't anyone else been *coached* by Bill!?\\\" and runs to the women's bathroom to cry, and imagines sitting with her thirteen-year-old self, who proclaims that she is not a victim, but a hero. The two look at each other silently with mutual understanding, coming to the realization that it wasn't Jennifer's fault.\",\n          \"Documentary-style drama showing the events that led up to the tragic incident on January 30, 1972 in the Northern Ireland town of Derry when a protest march led by civil rights activist Ivan Cooper was fired upon by British troops, killing 13 protesters and wounding 14 more.\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5021,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

She is bitter about her life, she not having male companionship in large part because she is overweight, while her bitterness in turn does not endear her to people. She is initially angry with her best friend, Bunny, for signing her up to a lonely hearts club, but eventually decides to give it a try. Through it, she meets Ray Fernandez, a suave Spanish immigrant living in New York, he who contacted Martha as the first through the club. After Ray's trip to Mobile to meet Martha, they fall in love. Upon a subsequent visit Martha makes to Ray in New York - which leads to her being fired in part for her time off work - he decides to be up front with her: that she is not only not his \\\"first\\\" but that he is really a con man who, primarily through the club, seduces then bilks lonely women of their money. Pretending to be his sister to prospective targets, Martha decides to join Ray on his cons as they travel the country together. Their differences in style causes problems, Martha who is more direct, more impatient and more violent, she who is the first to consider killing to get what they want. But what has the potential to be the primary cause of their downfall is Martha's jealousy over Ray even pretending to seduce other women, let alone any time he may have sex with them.Based on the true story of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, who met through a lonely-hearts correspondence club. Ray is weedy, feral, and untrustworthy; Martha is enormous, compulsive, and needy. Together, they play out a horrifying scheme in which he lures lonely women out on dates and proposes marriage to them, with her pretending to be his sister. They take the women's savings and then murder them remorselessly. Dank, claustrophobic, and weirdly engrossing, this movie never quite gives in to the comforts of conventional narrative. Francois Truffaut named it as his favorite American film.The film opens by introducing Martha Beck (), a supervising nurse in a hospital that is said to be in Mobile, Alabama. Martha catches two underlings having a brief romantic interlude in one of the labs and berates them for doing so. Martha is bitter and vindictive; she is overweight and lonely, lashing out at those who are unlucky enough to be under her command at the hospital, while at home she is saddled with an elderly mother () who still calls Martha her \\\"little girl\\\". Martha's best friend, Bunny (), surprises Martha by sending for an application to a lonely hearts club, thinking that all Martha needs to be happy is a man.At first Martha is resentful that Bunny has done this, but soon she is corresponding with a suave man named Raymond Fernandez (). Raymond gives Martha a vague representation of his life in New York, and comes to visit her after many weeks of exchanging letters. Martha is smitten with the handsome Ray, and their relationship immediately turns sexual. In a bizarre twist, Martha gives her mother a sleeping pill so that she and Raymond can be alone, then the two of them share a sexual encounter while her mother sleeps nearby on the couch.When Raymond returns to New York, he borrows a small \\\"loan\\\" from Martha, then sends her a telegram from New York saying that he can no longer correspond with her. Martha is despondent and enlists Bunny's help in pulling an extreme stunt: she tells Raymond that she has attempted suicide because she cannot live without him. Raymond seems flattered by Martha's devotion and invites her to New York, where he makes a startling revelation to her: he is actually a con man who meets lonely women through various lonely hearts clubs, then takes them for as much money and valuables as he can. After meeting Martha he realized she had no assets and moved on, but Martha is willing to forgive him for his deception. Raymond seems to be interested in Martha's strange devotion to him, and he tells her one day he will marry her for real.When Martha returns home to Mobile, she finds that her supervisor has uncovered some torrid correspondence with Ray that Martha had stored in her desk. Martha lashes out at him bitterly and resigns, claiming that she went to New York to be married and her final check can be made out to Mrs. Ray Fernandez. At home, Martha continues the charade, telling her mother and Bunny that she and Raymond have been married. Raymond is furious, especially when he realizes that Martha intends to bring her mother along with her to New York to move in with Ray. Raymond forbids it, saying that Martha can come but she absolutely cannot bring her mother, even going so far as to tell Martha to \\\"put a pillow over her face\\\" to get rid of her. Instead, Martha puts her mother in a rest home and abandons her, even though she weeps and pleads with Martha to take her along. Finally the woman curses Martha as she leaves, leaning out of a window and shouting after her \\\"Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! I hope someone does this to you.\\\"Martha and Raymond immediately begin their new business of swindling lonely women out of their savings, starting with a spinster schoolteacher. Raymond tells her that Martha is his \\\"sister\\\", and Martha accompanies them on their honeymoon, but Martha takes the new bride's belongings the first night and the bride storms out in a fury. Martha pays her no mind, threatening to expose the woman's torrid correspondence with Raymond to her superintendent.Martha seems to have no problem handling this first victim, who is unattractive and mawkish. But she remains hesitant about Raymond's \\\"profession\\\", jealous that he may choose a more attractive woman to swindle and make love to her. Their next mark proves to be a little different. Myrtle Young () is a spunky Southern woman who makes no secret about her attraction to Raymond. She has hired Raymond in a business transaction; Myrtle is pregnant out of wedlock, and she wants Raymond to pose as her husband to save face for her family. However, when she finds Raymond handsome, she turns on the charm, much to Martha's jealous displeasure. When Myrtle buys Raymond a toupee as his wedding gift, Martha scoffs at it, but Raymond lies and tells Martha that he bought it for himself. Myrtle later sneaks into Raymond's bedroom and tries to seduce him, while Martha watches in secret. Raymond rejects Myrtle's advances, but Myrtle reveals Raymond's fabrication about the toupee to Martha, who becomes furious. When her conversation with Myrtle turns hostile, Myrtle tells Martha that she is now married to Raymond and she intends to make a go of it. She plans on taking Raymond back to her wealthy family in Little Rock, where she will introduce him to her family, sending Martha back to Mobile on her own. In response, Martha gives Myrtle a handful of pills that\\nmake her violently ill. The next morning Raymond, knowing Myrtle is gravely ill, puts her on a bus for Little Rock, promising to drive her car and belongings there and meet her. But after he leaves her on the bus, she dies and her body is discovered by the bus driver.Raymond next arranges a meeting with a younger woman named Evelyn () who has a large home near a lake. Martha and Raymond bicker the whole time they are at Evelyn's; Martha even goes so far as to suggest that Evelyn pair her off in a bedroom with Raymond, which strikes Evelyn as strange since she has been told Martha and Raymond are brother and sister. Finally, when Martha spots Raymond making out on a blanket with Evelyn, she hurls herself into the lake and tries to drown herself. Raymond pulls her out, kissing and comforting her, while Evelyn looks on, confused and disturbed.Aborting their con on Evelyn, Raymond decides it is time to give Martha what she has always wanted: a suburban home. They find a home in Valley Stream, NY, but Raymond quickly becomes frustrated as their funds dwindle.Raymond decides it is time to go back to work, and they set up a meeting with an older woman named Janet Fay (). Janet is well into her 70s and is sitting on a bank account worth over ten thousand dollars, a fact that she happily discloses to Raymond. They move in quickly on Janet, with Raymond proposing to her and Janet moving out of her apartment and going back to Valley Stream with Martha and Raymond. Janet, however, is irritating to Martha from the very beginning, arguing with Martha about petty finances and making vaguely critical remarks about Martha's weight.They get Janet back to Valley Stream under the pretense of Janet marrying Raymond (who has told her his name is \\\"Charles Martin\\\") and then using her ten thousand dollars to open a hat shop. They get Janet to write them checks that they will presumably take to the bank and cash, absconding with the money.But just after she signs the checks, their deception begins to unravel. Martha and Raymond leave Janet alone so they can go to the basement and make love. When they all go to bed that night, Janet becomes suspicious and cannot sleep; she wonders why Martha and \\\"Charles\\\" took her away from Albany without even allowing her to call her daughter and son-in-law. She questions Martha about how well-hidden the checks are. Martha becomes short with Janet and wants to give her a sleeping pill, but Janet is neurotically afraid of pills and won't cooperate. Their argument spirals out of control until Janet becomes determined to use the telephone to call her family. Martha, of course, becomes hysterically angry over it and slaps Janet, raging at Raymond to \\\"give her back her checks and put her on a train back to Albany.\\\" Janet goes to her belongings and finds her jewelry missing. Janet finally understands that she is in great danger and begs Raymond and Martha to let her call her daughter. Finally Martha and Raymond realize that they must kill Janet to keep her from talking. Martha hands Raymond a hammer, and Raymond tells her \\\"You do it. If you love me, you'll do it.\\\" Immediately Martha strikes Janet in the head with the hammer. As she lays bleeding, Martha and Raymond tie a tourniquet around her neck and choke her to death. Martha reacts with calculated precision, barking at Raymond \\\"Get her off the rug!\\\", while Raymond seems terrified at what they are doing. With Janet now dead, Martha and Raymond make love, with Raymond stripping nude in front of Janet's body before going into the bedroom with Martha. The next day, Raymond and Martha dispose of Janet's body by putting it inside her traveling trunk and burying it under the floor of their basement. They send letters to Janet's family announcing that Janet has married and gone to Florida with her new husband.Raymond and Martha's next victim is Delphine Downing (), a widowed woman living alone with her young daughter, Rainelle (), who is around four years old. Martha and Raymond are living with Delphine, and Raymond promises Martha in a private moment that Delphine will be their last victim; he feels she has enough assets to allow Raymond and Martha to finally marry after they swindle her. Martha, however, is frustrated because she and Raymond no longer have much of a sex life because of their living conditions with Delphine. Raymond, as usual, swears he has no attraction to Delphine and that he hasn't made love to her.However, when Raymond takes Rainelle out for the day, Delphine is alone with Martha and confides in her: Delphine is pregnant with Raymond's baby. She tells Martha they've been making love every time Martha left the house, and that Raymond forbid Delphine to tell Martha they were physically intimate. Delphine thinks it is because Martha has puritanical values, but she wants Martha's help in breaking the news of her pregnancy to Raymond. She also wants Martha to suggest that Raymond marry Delphine on Valentine's Day.Martha is, of course, furious that Raymond has lied to her and has been making love to Delphine. She tells Delphine that Raymond will never marry her now, and that the only way to handle the situation is to abort the baby. To do this, Martha gives Delphine a handful of pills, but Delphine refuses to take them. Raymond comes back with Rainelle as Martha struggles with Delphine, and he walks into the situation unsure of what is going on. Martha tells Ray that Delphine has \\\"found out everything\\\" and was going to call the police. Delphine now realizes that she is in danger and begs Raymond to help her, but Raymond tells Martha to get Delphine's gun, and he shoots Delphine in the head. Martha debates what they should do with Rainelle; Raymond wants to abandon her at a children's home, but Martha feels Rainelle is too old and will remember details about them. She goes to the basement and fills a washtub with water, then takes Rainelle downstairs and drowns her in it, while Raymond listens upstairs, horrified.Martha has resigned herself to the fact that Raymond will never be truthful to her. Raymond promises that he can set up another meeting with another victim in New Orleans, and he swears to Martha he will not touch her or make love to her. \\\"I didn't touch Delphine, did I?\\\" he rationalizes. Martha kisses him passionately and goes upstairs, where she phones the police and summons them to the house pretending to be a neighbor. When the police arrive, she goes downstairs to let them in, kissing Raymond one more time.In the film's denouement, Martha is in prison, where a matron meets her to take her to her first day on trial for the crimes she has committed with Raymond. This will be the first time she has seen Raymond since her incarceration, and she is excited. The matron gives Martha a letter from Raymond, which Martha reads alone as she sits on a bench. In the letter, Raymond professes his love for Martha again; he tells her she is the only woman he will ever love, and the only woman he has ever loved. He looks forward to the possibility that one day when they are old, they may have a short time to spend together. The film ends with a title card that informs the viewers that Martha and Raymond were executed for their crimes while incarcerated in Sing Sing prison.\",\n          \"Unlike the book, this film is really an anecdotal biography of Stephen Hawking.

The characters in it are not testoserone-driven or in any way the pumped-up dumbed-down characters we have seen in recent decades.  They are sensitive, but open to communication, a little irrational at times, but still human.

Every single one of the women thought it was excellent.', 'Granted, this is a common rationale used by people who think themselves movie critics, but just you try seeing with a member of the opposite sex, and see how your opinions differ.', 'This is the first movie of a New Hollywood, tho it will certainly not be remmebered as such.

She is bitter about her life, she not having male companionship in large part because she is overweight, while her bitterness in turn does not endear her to people. She is initially angry with her best friend, Bunny, for signing her up to a lonely hearts club, but eventually decides to give it a try. Through it, she meets Ray Fernandez, a suave Spanish immigrant living in New York, he who contacted Martha as the first through the club. After Ray's trip to Mobile to meet Martha, they fall in love. Upon a subsequent visit Martha makes to Ray in New York - which leads to her being fired in part for her time off work - he decides to be up front with her: that she is not only not his \\\"first\\\" but that he is really a con man who, primarily through the club, seduces then bilks lonely women of their money. Pretending to be his sister to prospective targets, Martha decides to join Ray on his cons as they travel the country together. Their differences in style causes problems, Martha who is more direct, more impatient and more violent, she who is the first to consider killing to get what they want. But what has the potential to be the primary cause of their downfall is Martha's jealousy over Ray even pretending to seduce other women, let alone any time he may have sex with them.Based on the true story of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, who met through a lonely-hearts correspondence club. Ray is weedy, feral, and untrustworthy; Martha is enormous, compulsive, and needy. Together, they play out a horrifying scheme in which he lures lonely women out on dates and proposes marriage to them, with her pretending to be his sister. They take the women's savings and then murder them remorselessly. Dank, claustrophobic, and weirdly engrossing, this movie never quite gives in to the comforts of conventional narrative. Francois Truffaut named it as his favorite American film.The film opens by introducing Martha Beck (), a supervising nurse in a hospital that is said to be in Mobile, Alabama. Martha catches two underlings having a brief romantic interlude in one of the labs and berates them for doing so. Martha is bitter and vindictive; she is overweight and lonely, lashing out at those who are unlucky enough to be under her command at the hospital, while at home she is saddled with an elderly mother () who still calls Martha her \\\"little girl\\\". Martha's best friend, Bunny (), surprises Martha by sending for an application to a lonely hearts club, thinking that all Martha needs to be happy is a man.At first Martha is resentful that Bunny has done this, but soon she is corresponding with a suave man named Raymond Fernandez (). Raymond gives Martha a vague representation of his life in New York, and comes to visit her after many weeks of exchanging letters. Martha is smitten with the handsome Ray, and their relationship immediately turns sexual. In a bizarre twist, Martha gives her mother a sleeping pill so that she and Raymond can be alone, then the two of them share a sexual encounter while her mother sleeps nearby on the couch.When Raymond returns to New York, he borrows a small \\\"loan\\\" from Martha, then sends her a telegram from New York saying that he can no longer correspond with her. Martha is despondent and enlists Bunny's help in pulling an extreme stunt: she tells Raymond that she has attempted suicide because she cannot live without him. Raymond seems flattered by Martha's devotion and invites her to New York, where he makes a startling revelation to her: he is actually a con man who meets lonely women through various lonely hearts clubs, then takes them for as much money and valuables as he can. After meeting Martha he realized she had no assets and moved on, but Martha is willing to forgive him for his deception. Raymond seems to be interested in Martha's strange devotion to him, and he tells her one day he will marry her for real.When Martha returns home to Mobile, she finds that her supervisor has uncovered some torrid correspondence with Ray that Martha had stored in her desk. Martha lashes out at him bitterly and resigns, claiming that she went to New York to be married and her final check can be made out to Mrs. Ray Fernandez. At home, Martha continues the charade, telling her mother and Bunny that she and Raymond have been married. Raymond is furious, especially when he realizes that Martha intends to bring her mother along with her to New York to move in with Ray. Raymond forbids it, saying that Martha can come but she absolutely cannot bring her mother, even going so far as to tell Martha to \\\"put a pillow over her face\\\" to get rid of her. Instead, Martha puts her mother in a rest home and abandons her, even though she weeps and pleads with Martha to take her along. Finally the woman curses Martha as she leaves, leaning out of a window and shouting after her \\\"Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! I hope someone does this to you.\\\"Martha and Raymond immediately begin their new business of swindling lonely women out of their savings, starting with a spinster schoolteacher. Raymond tells her that Martha is his \\\"sister\\\", and Martha accompanies them on their honeymoon, but Martha takes the new bride's belongings the first night and the bride storms out in a fury. Martha pays her no mind, threatening to expose the woman's torrid correspondence with Raymond to her superintendent.Martha seems to have no problem handling this first victim, who is unattractive and mawkish. But she remains hesitant about Raymond's \\\"profession\\\", jealous that he may choose a more attractive woman to swindle and make love to her. Their next mark proves to be a little different. Myrtle Young () is a spunky Southern woman who makes no secret about her attraction to Raymond. She has hired Raymond in a business transaction; Myrtle is pregnant out of wedlock, and she wants Raymond to pose as her husband to save face for her family. However, when she finds Raymond handsome, she turns on the charm, much to Martha's jealous displeasure. When Myrtle buys Raymond a toupee as his wedding gift, Martha scoffs at it, but Raymond lies and tells Martha that he bought it for himself. Myrtle later sneaks into Raymond's bedroom and tries to seduce him, while Martha watches in secret. Raymond rejects Myrtle's advances, but Myrtle reveals Raymond's fabrication about the toupee to Martha, who becomes furious. When her conversation with Myrtle turns hostile, Myrtle tells Martha that she is now married to Raymond and she intends to make a go of it. She plans on taking Raymond back to her wealthy family in Little Rock, where she will introduce him to her family, sending Martha back to Mobile on her own. In response, Martha gives Myrtle a handful of pills that\\nmake her violently ill. The next morning Raymond, knowing Myrtle is gravely ill, puts her on a bus for Little Rock, promising to drive her car and belongings there and meet her. But after he leaves her on the bus, she dies and her body is discovered by the bus driver.Raymond next arranges a meeting with a younger woman named Evelyn () who has a large home near a lake. Martha and Raymond bicker the whole time they are at Evelyn's; Martha even goes so far as to suggest that Evelyn pair her off in a bedroom with Raymond, which strikes Evelyn as strange since she has been told Martha and Raymond are brother and sister. Finally, when Martha spots Raymond making out on a blanket with Evelyn, she hurls herself into the lake and tries to drown herself. Raymond pulls her out, kissing and comforting her, while Evelyn looks on, confused and disturbed.Aborting their con on Evelyn, Raymond decides it is time to give Martha what she has always wanted: a suburban home. They find a home in Valley Stream, NY, but Raymond quickly becomes frustrated as their funds dwindle.Raymond decides it is time to go back to work, and they set up a meeting with an older woman named Janet Fay (). Janet is well into her 70s and is sitting on a bank account worth over ten thousand dollars, a fact that she happily discloses to Raymond. They move in quickly on Janet, with Raymond proposing to her and Janet moving out of her apartment and going back to Valley Stream with Martha and Raymond. Janet, however, is irritating to Martha from the very beginning, arguing with Martha about petty finances and making vaguely critical remarks about Martha's weight.They get Janet back to Valley Stream under the pretense of Janet marrying Raymond (who has told her his name is \\\"Charles Martin\\\") and then using her ten thousand dollars to open a hat shop. They get Janet to write them checks that they will presumably take to the bank and cash, absconding with the money.But just after she signs the checks, their deception begins to unravel. Martha and Raymond leave Janet alone so they can go to the basement and make love. When they all go to bed that night, Janet becomes suspicious and cannot sleep; she wonders why Martha and \\\"Charles\\\" took her away from Albany without even allowing her to call her daughter and son-in-law. She questions Martha about how well-hidden the checks are. Martha becomes short with Janet and wants to give her a sleeping pill, but Janet is neurotically afraid of pills and won't cooperate. Their argument spirals out of control until Janet becomes determined to use the telephone to call her family. Martha, of course, becomes hysterically angry over it and slaps Janet, raging at Raymond to \\\"give her back her checks and put her on a train back to Albany.\\\" Janet goes to her belongings and finds her jewelry missing. Janet finally understands that she is in great danger and begs Raymond and Martha to let her call her daughter. Finally Martha and Raymond realize that they must kill Janet to keep her from talking. Martha hands Raymond a hammer, and Raymond tells her \\\"You do it. If you love me, you'll do it.\\\" Immediately Martha strikes Janet in the head with the hammer. As she lays bleeding, Martha and Raymond tie a tourniquet around her neck and choke her to death. Martha reacts with calculated precision, barking at Raymond \\\"Get her off the rug!\\\", while Raymond seems terrified at what they are doing. With Janet now dead, Martha and Raymond make love, with Raymond stripping nude in front of Janet's body before going into the bedroom with Martha. The next day, Raymond and Martha dispose of Janet's body by putting it inside her traveling trunk and burying it under the floor of their basement. They send letters to Janet's family announcing that Janet has married and gone to Florida with her new husband.Raymond and Martha's next victim is Delphine Downing (), a widowed woman living alone with her young daughter, Rainelle (), who is around four years old. Martha and Raymond are living with Delphine, and Raymond promises Martha in a private moment that Delphine will be their last victim; he feels she has enough assets to allow Raymond and Martha to finally marry after they swindle her. Martha, however, is frustrated because she and Raymond no longer have much of a sex life because of their living conditions with Delphine. Raymond, as usual, swears he has no attraction to Delphine and that he hasn't made love to her.However, when Raymond takes Rainelle out for the day, Delphine is alone with Martha and confides in her: Delphine is pregnant with Raymond's baby. She tells Martha they've been making love every time Martha left the house, and that Raymond forbid Delphine to tell Martha they were physically intimate. Delphine thinks it is because Martha has puritanical values, but she wants Martha's help in breaking the news of her pregnancy to Raymond. She also wants Martha to suggest that Raymond marry Delphine on Valentine's Day.Martha is, of course, furious that Raymond has lied to her and has been making love to Delphine. She tells Delphine that Raymond will never marry her now, and that the only way to handle the situation is to abort the baby. To do this, Martha gives Delphine a handful of pills, but Delphine refuses to take them. Raymond comes back with Rainelle as Martha struggles with Delphine, and he walks into the situation unsure of what is going on. Martha tells Ray that Delphine has \\\"found out everything\\\" and was going to call the police. Delphine now realizes that she is in danger and begs Raymond to help her, but Raymond tells Martha to get Delphine's gun, and he shoots Delphine in the head. Martha debates what they should do with Rainelle; Raymond wants to abandon her at a children's home, but Martha feels Rainelle is too old and will remember details about them. She goes to the basement and fills a washtub with water, then takes Rainelle downstairs and drowns her in it, while Raymond listens upstairs, horrified.Martha has resigned herself to the fact that Raymond will never be truthful to her. Raymond promises that he can set up another meeting with another victim in New Orleans, and he swears to Martha he will not touch her or make love to her. \\\"I didn't touch Delphine, did I?\\\" he rationalizes. Martha kisses him passionately and goes upstairs, where she phones the police and summons them to the house pretending to be a neighbor. When the police arrive, she goes downstairs to let them in, kissing Raymond one more time.In the film's denouement, Martha is in prison, where a matron meets her to take her to her first day on trial for the crimes she has committed with Raymond. This will be the first time she has seen Raymond since her incarceration, and she is excited. The matron gives Martha a letter from Raymond, which Martha reads alone as she sits on a bench. In the letter, Raymond professes his love for Martha again; he tells her she is the only woman he will ever love, and the only woman he has ever loved. He looks forward to the possibility that one day when they are old, they may have a short time to spend together. The film ends with a title card that informs the viewers that Martha and Raymond were executed for their crimes while incarcerated in Sing Sing prison.\",\n          \"Unlike the book, this film is really an anecdotal biography of Stephen Hawking.

As for Aaron in the shape of Harry Lennix he is actually quite convincing albeit not quite in the same league as Kenneth Brannagh who did the all time finest Shakespeare mischievery playing Iago in Othello. But Brannagh as a Moor would be downright laughable - so a compromise well turned out.\\\", \\\"The modernisation of Shakespeare is in my opinion an impossibility. Some of his plays have a plot which makes a good basis for a modern production, but Shakespeare's absolute fort\\u00e9 is his language and his linguistic jokes and acting in old English requires settings true to the play. That said, I think some of the scenes worked better in this surrealistic environment than they would have - scenes like Titus assembling his men for the shot at the Gods, or the messenger returning his sons' heads in a theater truck. That was novel.\\\", 'As for the overall feel of this movie, only one word suffices: Madness.'\"\n        ],\n        \"num_unique_values\": 214,\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"synopsis\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"In the early 1950s, Martha Beck, who lives with her slightly senile mother, is the head nurse in a Mobile, Alabama hospital. She is bitter about her life, she not having male companionship in large part because she is overweight, while her bitterness in turn does not endear her to people. She is initially angry with her best friend, Bunny, for signing her up to a lonely hearts club, but eventually decides to give it a try. Through it, she meets Ray Fernandez, a suave Spanish immigrant living in New York, he who contacted Martha as the first through the club. After Ray's trip to Mobile to meet Martha, they fall in love. Upon a subsequent visit Martha makes to Ray in New York - which leads to her being fired in part for her time off work - he decides to be up front with her: that she is not only not his \\\"first\\\" but that he is really a con man who, primarily through the club, seduces then bilks lonely women of their money. Pretending to be his sister to prospective targets, Martha decides to join Ray on his cons as they travel the country together. Their differences in style causes problems, Martha who is more direct, more impatient and more violent, she who is the first to consider killing to get what they want. But what has the potential to be the primary cause of their downfall is Martha's jealousy over Ray even pretending to seduce other women, let alone any time he may have sex with them.Based on the true story of Raymond Fernandez and Martha Beck, who met through a lonely-hearts correspondence club. Ray is weedy, feral, and untrustworthy; Martha is enormous, compulsive, and needy. Together, they play out a horrifying scheme in which he lures lonely women out on dates and proposes marriage to them, with her pretending to be his sister. They take the women's savings and then murder them remorselessly. Dank, claustrophobic, and weirdly engrossing, this movie never quite gives in to the comforts of conventional narrative. Francois Truffaut named it as his favorite American film.The film opens by introducing Martha Beck (), a supervising nurse in a hospital that is said to be in Mobile, Alabama. Martha catches two underlings having a brief romantic interlude in one of the labs and berates them for doing so. Martha is bitter and vindictive; she is overweight and lonely, lashing out at those who are unlucky enough to be under her command at the hospital, while at home she is saddled with an elderly mother () who still calls Martha her \\\"little girl\\\". Martha's best friend, Bunny (), surprises Martha by sending for an application to a lonely hearts club, thinking that all Martha needs to be happy is a man.At first Martha is resentful that Bunny has done this, but soon she is corresponding with a suave man named Raymond Fernandez (). Raymond gives Martha a vague representation of his life in New York, and comes to visit her after many weeks of exchanging letters. Martha is smitten with the handsome Ray, and their relationship immediately turns sexual. In a bizarre twist, Martha gives her mother a sleeping pill so that she and Raymond can be alone, then the two of them share a sexual encounter while her mother sleeps nearby on the couch.When Raymond returns to New York, he borrows a small \\\"loan\\\" from Martha, then sends her a telegram from New York saying that he can no longer correspond with her. Martha is despondent and enlists Bunny's help in pulling an extreme stunt: she tells Raymond that she has attempted suicide because she cannot live without him. Raymond seems flattered by Martha's devotion and invites her to New York, where he makes a startling revelation to her: he is actually a con man who meets lonely women through various lonely hearts clubs, then takes them for as much money and valuables as he can. After meeting Martha he realized she had no assets and moved on, but Martha is willing to forgive him for his deception. Raymond seems to be interested in Martha's strange devotion to him, and he tells her one day he will marry her for real.When Martha returns home to Mobile, she finds that her supervisor has uncovered some torrid correspondence with Ray that Martha had stored in her desk. Martha lashes out at him bitterly and resigns, claiming that she went to New York to be married and her final check can be made out to Mrs. Ray Fernandez. At home, Martha continues the charade, telling her mother and Bunny that she and Raymond have been married. Raymond is furious, especially when he realizes that Martha intends to bring her mother along with her to New York to move in with Ray. Raymond forbids it, saying that Martha can come but she absolutely cannot bring her mother, even going so far as to tell Martha to \\\"put a pillow over her face\\\" to get rid of her. Instead, Martha puts her mother in a rest home and abandons her, even though she weeps and pleads with Martha to take her along. Finally the woman curses Martha as she leaves, leaning out of a window and shouting after her \\\"Goddamn you! I hope you end up like this! I hope someone does this to you.\\\"Martha and Raymond immediately begin their new business of swindling lonely women out of their savings, starting with a spinster schoolteacher. Raymond tells her that Martha is his \\\"sister\\\", and Martha accompanies them on their honeymoon, but Martha takes the new bride's belongings the first night and the bride storms out in a fury. Martha pays her no mind, threatening to expose the woman's torrid correspondence with Raymond to her superintendent.Martha seems to have no problem handling this first victim, who is unattractive and mawkish. But she remains hesitant about Raymond's \\\"profession\\\", jealous that he may choose a more attractive woman to swindle and make love to her. Their next mark proves to be a little different. Myrtle Young () is a spunky Southern woman who makes no secret about her attraction to Raymond. She has hired Raymond in a business transaction; Myrtle is pregnant out of wedlock, and she wants Raymond to pose as her husband to save face for her family. However, when she finds Raymond handsome, she turns on the charm, much to Martha's jealous displeasure. When Myrtle buys Raymond a toupee as his wedding gift, Martha scoffs at it, but Raymond lies and tells Martha that he bought it for himself. Myrtle later sneaks into Raymond's bedroom and tries to seduce him, while Martha watches in secret. Raymond rejects Myrtle's advances, but Myrtle reveals Raymond's fabrication about the toupee to Martha, who becomes furious. When her conversation with Myrtle turns hostile, Myrtle tells Martha that she is now married to Raymond and she intends to make a go of it. She plans on taking Raymond back to her wealthy family in Little Rock, where she will introduce him to her family, sending Martha back to Mobile on her own. In response, Martha gives Myrtle a handful of pills that\\nmake her violently ill. The next morning Raymond, knowing Myrtle is gravely ill, puts her on a bus for Little Rock, promising to drive her car and belongings there and meet her. But after he leaves her on the bus, she dies and her body is discovered by the bus driver.Raymond next arranges a meeting with a younger woman named Evelyn () who has a large home near a lake. Martha and Raymond bicker the whole time they are at Evelyn's; Martha even goes so far as to suggest that Evelyn pair her off in a bedroom with Raymond, which strikes Evelyn as strange since she has been told Martha and Raymond are brother and sister. Finally, when Martha spots Raymond making out on a blanket with Evelyn, she hurls herself into the lake and tries to drown herself. Raymond pulls her out, kissing and comforting her, while Evelyn looks on, confused and disturbed.Aborting their con on Evelyn, Raymond decides it is time to give Martha what she has always wanted: a suburban home. They find a home in Valley Stream, NY, but Raymond quickly becomes frustrated as their funds dwindle.Raymond decides it is time to go back to work, and they set up a meeting with an older woman named Janet Fay (). Janet is well into her 70s and is sitting on a bank account worth over ten thousand dollars, a fact that she happily discloses to Raymond. They move in quickly on Janet, with Raymond proposing to her and Janet moving out of her apartment and going back to Valley Stream with Martha and Raymond. Janet, however, is irritating to Martha from the very beginning, arguing with Martha about petty finances and making vaguely critical remarks about Martha's weight.They get Janet back to Valley Stream under the pretense of Janet marrying Raymond (who has told her his name is \\\"Charles Martin\\\") and then using her ten thousand dollars to open a hat shop. They get Janet to write them checks that they will presumably take to the bank and cash, absconding with the money.But just after she signs the checks, their deception begins to unravel. Martha and Raymond leave Janet alone so they can go to the basement and make love. When they all go to bed that night, Janet becomes suspicious and cannot sleep; she wonders why Martha and \\\"Charles\\\" took her away from Albany without even allowing her to call her daughter and son-in-law. She questions Martha about how well-hidden the checks are. Martha becomes short with Janet and wants to give her a sleeping pill, but Janet is neurotically afraid of pills and won't cooperate. Their argument spirals out of control until Janet becomes determined to use the telephone to call her family. Martha, of course, becomes hysterically angry over it and slaps Janet, raging at Raymond to \\\"give her back her checks and put her on a train back to Albany.\\\" Janet goes to her belongings and finds her jewelry missing. Janet finally understands that she is in great danger and begs Raymond and Martha to let her call her daughter. Finally Martha and Raymond realize that they must kill Janet to keep her from talking. Martha hands Raymond a hammer, and Raymond tells her \\\"You do it. If you love me, you'll do it.\\\" Immediately Martha strikes Janet in the head with the hammer. As she lays bleeding, Martha and Raymond tie a tourniquet around her neck and choke her to death. Martha reacts with calculated precision, barking at Raymond \\\"Get her off the rug!\\\", while Raymond seems terrified at what they are doing. With Janet now dead, Martha and Raymond make love, with Raymond stripping nude in front of Janet's body before going into the bedroom with Martha. The next day, Raymond and Martha dispose of Janet's body by putting it inside her traveling trunk and burying it under the floor of their basement. They send letters to Janet's family announcing that Janet has married and gone to Florida with her new husband.Raymond and Martha's next victim is Delphine Downing (), a widowed woman living alone with her young daughter, Rainelle (), who is around four years old. Martha and Raymond are living with Delphine, and Raymond promises Martha in a private moment that Delphine will be their last victim; he feels she has enough assets to allow Raymond and Martha to finally marry after they swindle her. Martha, however, is frustrated because she and Raymond no longer have much of a sex life because of their living conditions with Delphine. Raymond, as usual, swears he has no attraction to Delphine and that he hasn't made love to her.However, when Raymond takes Rainelle out for the day, Delphine is alone with Martha and confides in her: Delphine is pregnant with Raymond's baby. She tells Martha they've been making love every time Martha left the house, and that Raymond forbid Delphine to tell Martha they were physically intimate. Delphine thinks it is because Martha has puritanical values, but she wants Martha's help in breaking the news of her pregnancy to Raymond. She also wants Martha to suggest that Raymond marry Delphine on Valentine's Day.Martha is, of course, furious that Raymond has lied to her and has been making love to Delphine. She tells Delphine that Raymond will never marry her now, and that the only way to handle the situation is to abort the baby. To do this, Martha gives Delphine a handful of pills, but Delphine refuses to take them. Raymond comes back with Rainelle as Martha struggles with Delphine, and he walks into the situation unsure of what is going on. Martha tells Ray that Delphine has \\\"found out everything\\\" and was going to call the police. Delphine now realizes that she is in danger and begs Raymond to help her, but Raymond tells Martha to get Delphine's gun, and he shoots Delphine in the head. Martha debates what they should do with Rainelle; Raymond wants to abandon her at a children's home, but Martha feels Rainelle is too old and will remember details about them. She goes to the basement and fills a washtub with water, then takes Rainelle downstairs and drowns her in it, while Raymond listens upstairs, horrified.Martha has resigned herself to the fact that Raymond will never be truthful to her. Raymond promises that he can set up another meeting with another victim in New Orleans, and he swears to Martha he will not touch her or make love to her. \\\"I didn't touch Delphine, did I?\\\" he rationalizes. Martha kisses him passionately and goes upstairs, where she phones the police and summons them to the house pretending to be a neighbor. When the police arrive, she goes downstairs to let them in, kissing Raymond one more time.In the film's denouement, Martha is in prison, where a matron meets her to take her to her first day on trial for the crimes she has committed with Raymond. This will be the first time she has seen Raymond since her incarceration, and she is excited. The matron gives Martha a letter from Raymond, which Martha reads alone as she sits on a bench. In the letter, Raymond professes his love for Martha again; he tells her she is the only woman he will ever love, and the only woman he has ever loved. He looks forward to the possibility that one day when they are old, they may have a short time to spend together. The film ends with a title card that informs the viewers that Martha and Raymond were executed for their crimes while incarcerated in Sing Sing prison.\",\n          \"Unlike the book, this film is really an anecdotal biography of Stephen Hawking.
